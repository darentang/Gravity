# Gravity

## Description
Code I wrote for an HSC major project. Rip off of KSP written in Lua using the Love2D game engine.

## Installation
1. Install Love2D 0.9.2

For Ubuntu/ Debian:
~~~~{.sh}
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install love=0.9.1-4ubuntu1
~~~~

For Windows/ Mac just use the installer at the Love2D [website](https://love2d.org/)

2. Clone this repository to your local directory
~~~~{.sh}
 git clone https://github.com/darentang/Gravity.git
~~~~

3. Run the game like this
~~~{.sh}
 cd YOUR_DIR
 love src
~~~

*Note*: Make sure Love2D v 0.9.2 is installed instead of a later version.
